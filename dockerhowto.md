How to use this image
All examples in this guide use the public image. If you’ve mirrored the repository for your own use (for example, to your Docker Hub namespace), update your commands to reference the mirrored image instead of the public one.

For example:

Public image: dhi.io/<repository>:<tag>
Mirrored image: <your-namespace>/dhi-<repository>:<tag>
For the examples, you must first use docker login dhi.io to authenticate to the registry to pull the images.

Use as a base image
Use this image as a base for building custom containerized applications.

FROM dhi.io/alpine-base:<tag>

# Install additional packages
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache \
    curl \
    git \
    ca-certificates

# Copy your application
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Set the command to run
CMD ["./your-application"]
Interactive shell access
To start an interactive shell session:

$ docker run -it --rm dhi.io/alpine-base:<tag>
Running as the nonroot user
By default, the image runs as root, but it includes a pre-configured nonroot user for security. You can switch to the nonroot user:

FROM dhi.io/alpine-base:<tag>

# Switch to the existing nonroot user
USER nonroot

CMD ["sh"]
Image variants
Docker Hardened Images come in different variants depending on their intended use.

Runtime variants are designed to run your application in production. These images are intended to be used either directly or as the FROM image in the final stage of a multi-stage build. These images typically:

Run as the nonroot user
Do not include a shell or a package manager
Contain only the minimal set of libraries needed to run the app
Build-time variants typically include dev in the variant name and are intended for use in the first stage of a multi-stage Dockerfile. These images typically:

Run as the root user
Include a shell and package manager
Are used to build or compile applications
FIPS variants include fips in the variant name and tag. They come in both runtime and build-time variants. These variants use cryptographic modules that have been validated under FIPS 140, a U.S. government standard for secure cryptographic operations. For example, usage of MD5 fails in FIPS variants.

Migrate to a Docker Hardened Image
To migrate your application to a Docker Hardened Image, you must update your Dockerfile. At minimum, you must update the base image in your existing Dockerfile to a Docker Hardened Image. This and a few other common changes are listed in the following table of migration notes.

Item	Migration note
Base image	Replace your base images in your Dockerfile with a Docker Hardened Image.
Package management	Non-dev images, intended for runtime, don't contain package managers. Use package managers only in images with a dev tag.
Non-root user	By default, non-dev images, intended for runtime, run as the nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are accessible to the nonroot user.
Multi-stage build	Utilize images with a dev tag for build stages and non-dev images for runtime. For binary executables, use a static image for runtime.
TLS certificates	Docker Hardened Images contain standard TLS certificates by default. There is no need to install TLS certificates.
Ports	Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images can't bind to privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid issues, configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the container.
Entry point	Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Inspect entry points for Docker Hardened Images and update your Dockerfile if necessary.
No shell	By default, non-dev images, intended for runtime, don't contain a shell. Use dev images in build stages to run shell commands and then copy artifacts to the runtime stage.
The following steps outline the general migration process.

Find hardened images for your app.

A hardened image may have several variants. Inspect the image tags and find the image variant that meets your needs.

Update the base image in your Dockerfile.

Update the base image in your application's Dockerfile to the hardened image you found in the previous step. For framework images, this is typically going to be an image tagged as dev because it has the tools needed to install packages and dependencies.

For multi-stage Dockerfiles, update the runtime image in your Dockerfile.

To ensure that your final image is as minimal as possible, you should use a multi-stage build. All stages in your Dockerfile should use a hardened image. While intermediary stages will typically use images tagged as dev, your final runtime stage should use a non-dev image variant.

Install additional packages

Docker Hardened Images contain minimal packages in order to reduce the potential attack surface. You may need to install additional packages in your Dockerfile. Inspect the image variants to identify which packages are already installed.

Only images tagged as dev typically have package managers. You should use a multi-stage Dockerfile to install the packages. Install the packages in the build stage that uses a dev image. Then, if needed, copy any necessary artifacts to the runtime stage that uses a non-dev image.

For Alpine-based images, you can use apk to install packages. For Debian-based images, you can use apt-get to install packages.

Troubleshooting migration
The following are common issues that you may encounter during migration.

General debugging
The hardened images intended for runtime don't contain a shell nor any tools for debugging. The recommended method for debugging applications built with Docker Hardened Images is to use Docker Debug to attach to these containers. Docker Debug provides a shell, common debugging tools, and lets you install other tools in an ephemeral, writable layer that only exists during the debugging session.

Permissions
By default image variants intended for runtime, run as the nonroot user. Ensure that necessary files and directories are accessible to the nonroot user. You may need to copy files to different directories or change permissions so your application running as the nonroot user can access them.

Privileged ports
Non-dev hardened images run as a nonroot user by default. As a result, applications in these images can't bind to privileged ports (below 1024) when running in Kubernetes or in Docker Engine versions older than 20.10. To avoid issues, configure your application to listen on port 1025 or higher inside the container, even if you map it to a lower port on the host. For example, docker run -p 80:8080 my-image will work because the port inside the container is 8080, and docker run -p 80:81 my-image won't work because the port inside the container is 81.

No shell
By default, image variants intended for runtime don't contain a shell. Use dev images in build stages to run shell commands and then copy any necessary artifacts into the runtime stage. In addition, use Docker Debug to debug containers with no shell.

Entry point
Docker Hardened Images may have different entry points than images such as Docker Official Images. Use docker inspect to inspect entry points for Docker Hardened Images and update your Dockerfile if necessary.

Package differences
Alpine Linux uses the apk package manager instead of apt-get (Debian/Ubuntu). Some package names may be different between Alpine and Debian. Common differences:

glibc vs musl libc (Alpine uses musl)
Package naming conventions may differ
Some packages may not be available in Alpine repositories
Consult the Alpine package database at https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/ to find the correct package names for your needs.
